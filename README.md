## Auto-Stop Challenge
This challenge tests the ability … to automatically stop a hauled load in a controlled manner. 
A lineside distance marker … will be positioned adjacent to the track at point A. The test locomotive, complete with load vehicles, must … pass it at a speed of not less than 10 km/h. 
On passing point A, the locomotive must detect the lineside distance marker and automatically apply the automatic braking mode.
The locomotive should automatically stop with its front as close to point B as possible. Point B will be positioned 25 m along the track beyond point A. Teams should note that a downward gradient exists from point A to point B.
